| arc42                 | A template for documenting software and system architecture, used in this project (Version 8.2 EN, January 2023), created by Hruschka, Starke, et al. 
| Frontend              | The web-based user interface of the application, built using React.js, responsible for presenting questions, collecting answers, and displaying feedback. 
| Backend               | The server-side component of the system, built using Node.js and Express, handling API requests, game logic, and data management.                  
| Large Language Model (LLM) | An external AI model (e.g., via Groq API) integrated into the system to generate hints for quiz questions, aiming to avoid hallucinations or incorrect responses. 
| Wikidata              | A free, collaborative knowledge base providing structured data, used by the system to automatically generate quiz questions and answers.          
| API                   | Application Programming Interface; a set of rules allowing communication between software components, e.g., RESTful APIs for user data and question creation. 
| Question Generation   | The process of automatically creating quiz questions, correct answers, and distractors using data retrieved from Wikidata.                        
| Hints                 | Contextual assistance provided to users during gameplay, generated by the LLM via an API call, based on the question or user input.                
| Distractors           | Incorrect answer options presented alongside the correct answer in quiz questions to challenge the user.                                          
| Game Modes            | Different gameplay variations, e.g., “Each wise man with his subject,” “Travel with us,” or “The hot question,” offering diverse user experiences. 
| Scalability           | The system’s ability to handle a large number of simultaneous users without performance degradation, a key quality goal.                        
| Reliability           | The system’s robustness in handling failures (e.g., LLM API downtime) while maintaining a seamless user experience, a key quality goal.          
| Usability             | The ease with which users can navigate and interact with the application, ensuring an intuitive and engaging experience, a key quality goal.    
| Performance           | The system’s ability to provide fast responses (e.g., <1s for hints, <3s for question generation), a key quality goal.                          
| Security              | The protection of user data through encryption, authentication, and compliance with GDPR, a key quality goal.                                   
| User Gateway          | A backend service handling user-related API requests, such as authentication and data retrieval, ensuring secure and efficient user management.   
| Game Service          | A backend service managing game logic, question presentation, and interaction with external APIs (Wikidata and LLM).                              
| MongoDB               | A NoSQL database used to store user data, game progress, and question history in JSON format, supporting scalability and flexibility.             
| React.js              | A JavaScript library used for building the responsive and dynamic frontend of the web application.                                               
| Node.js               | A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side, powering the backend of the application.                                       
| Express.js            | A web framework for Node.js, used to manage client requests and define RESTful API endpoints in the backend.                                      
| Bcrypt                | A library used for hashing and encrypting user passwords to ensure secure storage and authentication.                                            
| Docker                | A containerization platform used to deploy the application’s services (e.g., frontend, backend, database) in isolated, reproducible environments. 
| Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) | The cloud platform hosting the application, selected for its free tier and sufficient performance for production deployment.                   
| RESTful API           | A style of API design using HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) for communication between the frontend, backend, and external services.               
| SPARQL                | A query language used to retrieve structured data from Wikidata for question generation.                                                        
| Internationalization (i18n) | An optional feature allowing the application to support multiple languages, enhancing accessibility for diverse users.                       
| CRUD Operations       | Create, Read, Update, Delete operations managed by the User CRUD Service for handling user data in the database.                                
| Gateway Service       | The central entry point for routing external and internal API requests, ensuring security and load balancing.
