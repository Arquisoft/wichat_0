=== Fork a project from last year to use as a base

Since the project specification is similar to last year's, we need to choose
between building the project from scratch, or forking a project from last year.

Our decision is to base our project on last year's
link:https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_es04a[wiq_es04a] team.

**Advantages**

- A considerable amount of functionality is the same as last year, so we won't
  have to implement it.

**Disadvantages**

- Using other people's code can lead to confusion. Understanding an extraneaous
  codebase is complicated.

Status: **Accepted**
