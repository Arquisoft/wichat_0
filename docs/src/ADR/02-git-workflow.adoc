branching strategy.

The proposed workflow is the following. +
To make any change to the codebase:

. Branch from master
. Make all the changes, and commit them
. Create a pull request to merge the changes into master

It's important to constantly merge all the changes into master, and to avoid any
aditional long-lived branches. This reduces the effort of maintaining those
branches, and keeping them on sync.
