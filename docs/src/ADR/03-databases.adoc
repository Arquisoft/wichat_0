=== Database

Last year's project use two different databases:

. MariaDB for users
. MongoDB for questions

Because of a problem with MariaDB database, we all agree on still using two databases changing MariaDB to SQLite and maintaining MongoDB.
Then project's databases will be:

. SQLite for users
. MongoDB for questions

We think that is the easiest option for us in terms of implementation and to adapt old system functionality. 
SQLite is not only open source but also easy to use and efficient for small applications.

Status: **Accepted**
