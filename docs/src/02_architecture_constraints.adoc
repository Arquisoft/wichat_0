== Architecture Constraints

- **Frontend Restriction:**  
  The system will have at least a web frontend that will display images and answers, as well as a hint system that will allow users to obtain hints about the images.  

- **Web Deployment:**  
  The web application must be deployed and accessible via the internet.  

- **User Registration:**  
  Users will be able to register in the system and consult their participation history, including the number of games played, correct/incorrect answers, times, etc.  

- **Use of the Wikidata API:**  
  The questions' information will be automatically generated from Wikidata data.  

- **Use of an LLM:**  
  Users will be able to interact with the application for each question to obtain hints. A language model (LLM) will be accessed via an API. A technique must be introduced to generate hints from Wikidata data and mitigate incorrect answers and hallucinations during the conversation.  

- **Question Model:**  
  Questions must be answered within a set time limit. Each question will have one correct answer and several incorrect or distractor answers. Both the correct and incorrect answers will be generated automatically.  

- **Creation and Documentation of a Custom API:**  
  The system will allow access to user information through a documented API. The system will also provide access to generated questions through an API.

.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.
