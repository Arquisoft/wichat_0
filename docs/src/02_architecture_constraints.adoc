== Architecture Constraints


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Constraints        | Explanations        
| _Fixed data source_          | Questions, images, and hints must be generated exclusively from Wikidata data.
| _External language model_         | A LLM accessed through a predefined API will be used, limiting the choice of models and customization options.
|===

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Constraints        | Explanations        
| _Mandatory web platform_          | The application must be accessible via web browsers and deployed online.
| _Conversational hints logic_         | Hints must be generated while mitigating hallucinations using specific techniques, integrated with Wikidata.
| _Automatic generation_          | Both the questions and distractors must be generated automatically, restricting manual design.
| _Time-limited answers_         | Each question must be answered within a set time, necessitating efficient interaction and time management design.

=== Legal and Regulatory Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Constraints        | Explanations        
| _Privacy compliance_          | User data must comply with regulations like GDPR.

=== Product Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Constraints        | Explanations       
| _Fixed question format_          | Each question must have one correct answer and several incorrect ones generated automatically, with balanced and coherent options. 
| _User registration_          | The system must include functionalities for registration, participation history, and statistics.
| _Mandatory interaction_         | Users must interact with the system to obtain conversational hints about the questions.

=== Operational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Constraints        | Explanations        
| _Scalability_          | The system must support multiple simultaneous users.
