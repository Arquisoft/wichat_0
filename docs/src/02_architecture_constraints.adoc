== Architecture Constraints


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

In this section we will pinpoint the constraints that come into play for the design of our application and its architecture.

=== List of constraints

|===
| Constraint type | Constraint description | Repercussions

| Technical
| Using Git and GitHub for version control.
| Requires the team to get accustomed to GitHub and its functionalities. 

| Technical
| Deploying the application to access it through a web browser.
| Requires the team to get familiarized with tools and services such as Docker, Azure...

| Technical
| Using the project from the previous year.
| Requires the team to work starting from code authored and technologies selected by other people previous year's students of the chosen project.

| Technical
| Mandatory inclusion of LLM functionalities to help the user.
| Requires the team to get familiarized with the LLM selected (Qwen) and implement it into the program.

| Organizational
| There is a time limit established.
| The application must be developed in a few months, which sets a time limit for the team.

| Organizational
| Using pull requests for code submissions.
| Ensures that more than one person will be responsible of each commit.

| Organizational
| Holding regular team meetings.
| A team meeting must be held at least once a week (or more if required) and the participants and contents of said meeting must both be noted down.

| Conventional
| Developing an application with code up to standards.
| Code developed by the team must be as clear to understand as possible (i.e. following code conventions, or adding documentation), in order to ensure the maintainability of the application.

| Conventional
| Ensuring the LLM provides factual clues.
| Requires to adjust the LLM accordingly to ensure it does not provide any falsehoods that may confuse the player of the game.

| Conventional
| Following the Arc42 template in the documentation.
| The documentation to be provided in the project must be modelled after Arc42.
