== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

=== Requirements Overview

The requirements of this application are to develop an application which functionality is similar to the “Saber Y Ganar” Spanish program on TV. Users will have to select an answer to several questions proposed extracted from Wiki data, these questions will be automatically generated by its API.

Furthermore, for the development of this application the use of GitHub is required to have a repository with all members of the development team using several tools provided by this service. In addition to that the application will have to save the entrance of different users on a database, allowing them to make different tracking and having previous results of that specific user. 

Also, it must be said that during each question an IA assistant should be helping the user in case of need. This would require us, the development team, to use different LLM that is still to be decided which one will be use.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|Goal|Description
| Testability | Tests are going to be developed in order to test the different actions that our application will    provide. 
| Usability | We will do some user tests for different people of all ages in order to make our application usable by everyone. 
| Portability | Our application will allow its deployment of different devices at different times. 
| Security & Privacy | Our application will only allow the users themselves to see its own results, without considering some rankings that will involve all users. 
| Performance | Our application will be loading tests to confirm that runs correctly under “heavy conditions” in which there is much traffic of users.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
