== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

RTVE has hired the company ChattySw composed of students from the Oviedo School of Software Engineering (EII), to update a game-show like web application that was developed last year by the HappySw company. This application will be called WIChat, where users will be able to register and login to play. The basic game will consist of a game that shows a picture and the users have to guess what it is about. The users will have to answer a list of questions about those pictures from different domains obtaining points for each correct guess. This years update in the game-show will be the posibility of obtaining hints about the picture in  a conversational way from an external LLM. 

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

* The system must provide non-registered users with the option to sign up.
* The system must provide registered but not identified users with the option to log in.
* The system must only be used by registered users.
* The system will have at least a Web frontend which will show the pictures and answers as well as the hint system where the users can interact with the system to obtain hints about the pictures.
* The Web application should be deployed and accessible through the web.
* Users will be able to register to the system and obtain the historical data from their participation: number of games, questions passed and failed and times.
* Information about the questions will be automatically generated from Wikidata. 
* It should be possible to interact with the application in each question to obtain hints about the questions. For that, an LLM will be used which will be accessible through an API.
* It should be possible to use an approach to generate hints from Wikidata that mitigates the generation of incorrect answers or hallucinations. 
* The questions should be answered before some specific time.
* Each question should have a correct answer and several incorrect ones or distractors. The right answer and the distractors should be automatically generated.
* The system will give access to the information about the users through an API which should be documented.
* The system will give access to information about the generated questions through an API.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|Goal|Description
|Functional suitability|The system must fulfill its intended purpose effectively and efficiently, allowing users to register, log in, play the quiz, access their user statistics and get aid from the LLM during the questions.
|Reliability|The system should be reliable in generating questions from Wikidata, ensuring that questions are accurate and diverse. The LLM implemented in the system must be reliable and well trained to be able to help the users in answering the questions. The system shall handle user registrations, logins, and game data storage without errors.
|Availability|The system shall be available 99% of the time a user tries to access it.
|Maitainability|The system shall be designed and implemented in a way that facilitates easy maintenance and updates.
|Performance efficiency|The system shall deliver optimal performance, ensuring responsive interactions for users. The automatic generation of questions from Wikidata and the LLM responses with a real-time gameplay shall be efficient. The system shall handle 1000 concurrent users.
|Usability|The system shall provide a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to register, log in, and play the game. The system learning time for a user should be less than 3 hours.
|Portability|The system shall be portable to various web browsers and devices, ensuring a seamless experience for users regardless of their platform. It has to be optimized for different screen sizes and functionalities.
|Security|The system shall prioritize user data security. It must implement robust authentication mechanisms for user registration and login. The API access points for user information and generated questions must be secured with proper authorization.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
