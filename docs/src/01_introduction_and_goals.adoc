****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

=== Requirements Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the online "Saber y Ganar" quiz show application, developed last year by HappySw, with new features that incorporate large language models (LLMs) and Wikidata for a more interactive and engaging experience.

The key functional requirements of the system are:

* A Web frontend that presents pictures with questions for the users to answer.
* Users must be able to register, login, and view historical data related to their game performance (e.g., number of games, correct answers, time taken).
* The system should automatically generate questions and answers using Wikidata.
* Hints for the questions can be obtained through interaction with an external LLM via an API.
* The LLM should mitigate the generation of incorrect answers or hallucinations when providing hints.
* Each question will have a correct answer and multiple distractors, all generated automatically.
* The application must be deployable on the web and allow users to access their information via a documented API.
* There is a possibility for users to interact with the application in different game modes, such as “Each wise man with his subject,” “Travel with us,” or “The hot question.” (not yet implemented)

Optional features include internationalization, mobile version, users' ranking, multiplayer capabilities, and personalized game settings like adjusting time limits and the scope of questions.

=== Quality Goals

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

The quality goals for the architecture are as follows:
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Description
| *Scalability*  | The system must efficiently handle a high number of concurrent users without performance degradation, ensuring a seamless experience even under peak loads.
| *Reliability*  | The system must operate consistently under expected conditions, maintaining stability and minimizing downtime or unexpected failures.
| *Usability*    | The application must be intuitive, easy to learn, and user-friendly, enabling players to navigate, answer questions, and request hints effortlessly.
| *Performance*  | The system should deliver fast and responsive interactions, ensuring minimal delays when generating questions, processing answers, or providing hints.
| *Security*     | User data must be securely stored and accessible only to authorized users. The system must protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious activities.
|===
These quality goals will drive architectural decisions, particularly concerning how data is processed, stored, and presented to the user, as well as how external integrations (e.g., LLM API and Wikidata) are handled.

See section 10 (Quality Requirements) for a complete overview of quality scenarios.

=== Stakeholders
ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
