== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The software development company **ChattySw** has been hired by **RTVE** to update an online experimental version of the *Saber y Ganar* quiz show. The previous version, developed by **HappySw**, allowed users to answer quiz questions based on displayed images. The updated version, named **WIChat**, will introduce a new hint system powered by an external **Large Language Model (LLM)**, enabling users to obtain hints about the answers in a conversational way.

The key requirements include:

- A **Web frontend** to display images, questions, and a hint interaction system.
- **User registration** and historical tracking of participation data.
- **Automatic question and image generation** based on **Wikidata**.
- A **hint system** using an LLM accessible via an API.
- Mechanisms to **mitigate incorrect answers** or hallucinations from the LLM.
- **Timed questions** with a correct answer and distractors, both generated automatically.
- APIs to provide access to **user data** and **question information**, with proper documentation.


**Optional features**:

- Support for multiple **question subjects**.
- **Internationalization** (multi-language support).
- Different **game modes**, such as:
  - Each wise man with his subject
  - Travel with us
  - The hot question
  - Discovering cities
- **Mobile version**.
- More interactive **LLM integrations** (virtual assistant, AI opponent, etc.).
- Customizable game settings (e.g., time limits, number of questions, topic selection).
- **Group play** with statistics and leaderboards.
- **Live multiplayer mode** with competitive play.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

The top quality goals for the architecture include:

|===
| Quality Goal    | Description 
| **Scalability** | The system should handle a growing number of users efficiently. 
| **Usability**   | The interface should be intuitive, engaging, and accessible. 
| **Accuracy**    | The LLM hints and question generation should minimize incorrect or misleading information. 
| **Performance** | The game should have minimal latency in interactions, especially for real-time play. 
| **Security**    | User data and game integrity must be protected against unauthorized access. 
|===


=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
