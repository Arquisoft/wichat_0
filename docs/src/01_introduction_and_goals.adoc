== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the online "Saber y Ganar" quiz show application, developed last year by ChattySw, with new features that incorporate large language models (LLMs) and Wikidata for a more interactive and engaging experience. In our case
the game with its enhancements will be made ultimately from scratch, utilizing/taking a look at some code from last year's app for guidance/help. 

The key functional requirements of the system are:

* A Web frontend that presents pictures with questions for the users to answer.
* Users must be able to register, login, and view historical data related to their game performance (e.g., number of games, correct answers, time taken).
* The system should automatically generate questions and answers using Wikidata.
* Hints for the questions can be obtained through interaction with an external LLM via an API.
* The LLM should mitigate the generation of incorrect answers or hallucinations when providing hints.
* Each question will have a correct answer and multiple distractors, all generated automatically.
* Creation of two well documented APIs for accessing user data and the question creation tool.
* There is a possibility for users to interact with the application in different game modes, such as “Each wise man with his subject,” “Travel with us,” or “The hot question.”

Optional features include internationalization, mobile version, users' ranking, multiplayer capabilities, and personalized game settings like adjusting time limits and the scope of questions.

=== Quality Goals

The quality goals for the architecture are as follows:
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Scenario 
| **Scalability** | The system must be able to handle a large number of simultaneous users without a noticeable decrease in performance. 
| **Reliability** | The system must be robust enough to handle failures in the hint generation API and ensure the user experience is minimally impacted. 
| **Usability** | The application must be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly understand how to play, answer questions, and interact with hints. 
| **Performance** | The system should provide fast responses, particularly in generating questions and hints, without delays that impact the user experience. 
| **Security** | The system must ensure that user data is securely stored and accessible only to authorized users. 
|===
These quality goals will drive architectural decisions, particularly concerning how data is processed, stored, and presented to the user, as well as how external integrations (e.g., LLM API and Wikidata) are handled.
