== Risks and Technical Debts

[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
A comprehensive list of identified technical risks and technical debts, prioritized based on their potential impact.

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This principle underlines the importance of proactively identifying and assessing risks and technical debts in the architecture. Understanding these factors enables project managers, product owners, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions, ensuring stability and scalability.

.Form
A structured list of risks and technical debts, accompanied by proposed mitigation strategies to minimize or prevent negative impacts.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Risks
To evaluate the significance of the identified risks, we use a scale from 1 to 3, where 1 denotes low relevance, 2 medium relevance, and 3 high relevance.

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Relevance | Considerations
| Limited expertise in specific tools or programming languages | 2 | The team may encounter difficulties due to varying levels of familiarity with required tools and languages. To address this, we will prioritize the use of well-known technologies within the team while encouraging knowledge-sharing and individual learning efforts.
| Lack of prior collaboration within the team | 1 | Since the team has not worked together before, there is a risk of inefficiencies in coordination. Establishing clear communication channels and regularly updating each other on progress will mitigate this issue.
| Large team size | 1 | A higher number of contributors can complicate communication and workflow synchronization. Implementing structured meetings and documentation processes should help maintain efficiency.
| Potential delays in integrating external APIs | 2 | Depending on external data sources, such as Wikidata, might introduce latency or downtime risks. Developing fallback mechanisms and caching strategies can help mitigate disruptions.

=== Technical Debts
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Technical Debt | Considerations
| Code maintainability and quality | Adopting new languages and frameworks can lead to inconsistencies in coding standards. To prevent this, we will enforce code reviews through pull requests, ensuring peer validation and adherence to best practices.
| Deployment complexities | Since the team has limited experience with Docker and related deployment tools, deployment might pose challenges. To mitigate this, we will allocate time for learning and experimenting with deployment methodologies before the final implementation.
| Dependency on Wikidata | As the system relies on Wikidata, any service downtime could disrupt functionality. To address this, we have implemented a local question database to provide temporary resilience.
| Data integrity in database modifications | Structural changes in the relational database model require creating a new database, resulting in potential data loss. Establishing proper migration strategies and backup mechanisms will reduce this risk.
| Filtering and validation of Wikidata responses | Inconsistencies in Wikidata labeling can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant questions and answers. We have implemented filtering mechanisms but recognize the need for further refinement to improve accuracy.
| Code redundancy in game modes | Due to limited JavaScript experience, there is redundant code across different game modes, making maintenance difficult. Refactoring and modularizing common functionalities will enhance maintainability.
| Session management | The current session implementation does not include expiration, which poses security risks. Implementing session expiration policies will improve security and user management.

By systematically addressing these risks and technical debts, we aim to enhance project stability, maintainability, and long-term viability.
