== Risks and Technical Debts
|===
| *Risk* | *Explanation* | *Mitigation proposed* 
| Little knowledge of the technologies to be used | For all group members, this is the first time developing software that requires implementing an LLM | Search for knowledge on developing applications integrated with LLMs, along with the tools used for this.
Consult the code and documentation of last year's projects to observe the decisions that were made and the technologies they used for the rest of the development
| Lack of time | We may face time constraints in fulfilling all the requirements for each deliverable and meeting every deadline | Try to maintain a steady and sustainable development pace. Prioritize building functional components initially, then iterate and enhance from there
| Coordination and responsibility problems | It is probably the first time involvement in developing a project from scratch, including decisions on architecture, design, and implementation, introduces various challenges. Misunderstandings regarding tasks and version control management errors can result in individuals inadvertently disrupting the work of others. Additionally, the necessity to make numerous decisions and reach agreements increases the likelihood of errors, potentially consuming significant time and effort | To ensure effective collaboration and organization, follow the teachers' instructions regarding GitHub, including the use of features such as issues, pull requests, and maintain a disciplined approach to work from all team members, using a Kanban methodology integrated as a feature in GitHub
| Starting off from scratch? | We'll have to take the decision of starting our project from scratch or take another project from last year as "inspiration" or as a starting point| Why not both? Starting off from scratch can be really difficult, but if we have another project that serves as a guide or reference we'll be more productive and focus on new functionalities (such as the LLM integration) rather than in the basis development.
| Version Control Software Use | GitHub is one of the most (if not the most) popular version control tools in the market, however, some group member may be not acquainted with it, or even if we are, we still have to get to an agreement on how to work properly and consistently (unique commit format for all commits, wiki page rotation, conflict solving, etc.) | Starting slow with GitHub (making the project documentation) will help us to get used to it. Later, we'll discuss and register decisions on the workflow when developing.
| Spend more time developing than thinking | This one is pretty common, sometimes we just focus on producing huge amounts of code, often forgetting the importance of the previous phases, the ones that draw the line between a software developer and a software engineer/software architect. | Question the decisions "made on autopilot", remembering the goals we need to achieve when the application is done, and working smarter, not harder, on getting there.
