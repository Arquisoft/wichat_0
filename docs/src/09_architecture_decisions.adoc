== Architecture Decisions

The application will be carried out following a Microservices architecture. +

The service in charge of comunicating with WikiData will be coded using TypeSript. 
As the generation of questions is a huge part of our application we will play it safe by using TypeSript, a language that is similar to JavaSript but with static type checking.

Microservices Architecture:
The application will follow a Microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance. This approach allows different services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, improving fault tolerance and facilitating continuous deployment.

WikiData Service - TypeScript:
The service responsible for communicating with WikiData will be developed using TypeScript. Since generating questions is a critical part of our application, we decided to use TypeScript due to its static type checking, which helps prevent runtime errors and makes the codebase more maintainable. Additionally, TypeScript provides better tooling support and improves developer productivity by reducing debugging time.

Backend & Frontend Technologies:
The backend will be built using Node.js, as it is efficient for handling asynchronous operations and provides a vast ecosystem of libraries.
The frontend will be developed with React, a popular JavaScript library known for its component-based structure, performance optimizations, and reusability. React's virtual DOM improves rendering efficiency, making it a great choice for dynamic applications.

Database - MongoDB:
We have chosen MongoDB, a NoSQL database, because it provides flexibility in handling unstructured data, horizontal scalability, and high availability. Given that our data structure may evolve over time, MongoDBâ€™s schema-less nature allows us to adapt without complex migrations.

Deployment Strategy:
The application will be deployed on a server owned by one of the team members. This decision allows us to have full control over the deployment environment, reduce costs, and customize configurations based on our needs.

Switching from TypeScript to JavaScript:
We initially opted for TypeScript to improve code quality through static typing. However, after encountering integration issues, increased complexity, and longer development time, we decided to switch to JavaScript. JavaScript allows for faster iteration, broader community support, and reduced setup overhead, making it more practical for our project timeline.

CSS Modules for Styling:
We have chosen to use CSS Modules for styling because it:

Prevents style conflicts by scoping styles to individual components.
Improves maintainability by keeping styles modular and easy to manage.
Enhances reusability as styles are encapsulated within their respective components, reducing the risk of unintended global overrides.

These decisions were made to optimize performance, maintainability, and scalability while ensuring smooth development and deployment of our application.

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
