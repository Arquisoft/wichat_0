== Architecture Decisions
=== Client/Server architecture
We are going to have an architecture with a main application with a client and server, and several servers for the external services (users, WikiData, LLM, etc.) that will act as data APIs for the main application server.
These service servers will respond to requests by returning data that the main application will process and pass to the view.
