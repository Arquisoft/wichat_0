== Architecture Decisions

=== Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

=== Technology
We are going to use Spring to develop the project because:

* It gives us a lot of functionality already implemented so that we don't have to implement it ourselves.

* It allows us to use Java, which we are very used to and prefer over JavaScript.

=== Client/Server architecture
We are going to have an architecture with a main application with a client and server, and several servers for the external services (users, WikiData, LLM, etc.) that will act as data APIs for the main application server.
These service servers will respond to requests by returning data that the main application will process and pass to the view.
