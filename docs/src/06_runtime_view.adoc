== Runtime View
This section focuses on describing the behaviour and interactions of the system's building blocks in form of scenarios.

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

=== User registration
Users must create an account if they do not have one. The behaviour of the application is:

[plantuml,"Register diagram",png]
----
actor User
entity WA as "Web Application"
entity GS as "Gateway Service"
entity US as "User Service"
database DB as "MongoDB"

User -> WA : 1. Sends data
WA -> GS : 2. Forwards data
GS -> US : 3. Sends user addition request
US -> US : 4. Verify credentials

alt Correct credentials
    US -> US : 5. Encrypt password and save.
    US -> DB : 6. Adds the user to the database
    US --> GS : Responds with the new user
    GS --> WA : Forwards data
    WA --> User : Shows confirmation

else Incorrect credentials
    US --> GS : Sends error
    GS --> WA : Forwards error
    WA --> User : Shows error
end

----

The errorless behaviour will be:

. The new user types the required information to create an account.

. Them, AddUser.js (from package webapp) collects this information and sends it via post to the "/addUser" url.

. The Gateway Service will answer to this petition by forwarding the petition to the User Service and saving the user data to the response (if any error happened, it would be saved here).

. The User Service then verifies that all the necessary credentials are stored in the request

=== User authentication


Users must have an account to use the application. The following sequence diagram shows how the application behaves when logging in.

[plantuml,"Login diagram",png]
----
actor User
entity WA as "Web Application"
entity GS as "Gateway Service"
entity UAS as "User Authentication Service"
database DB as "MongoDB"

User -> WA : 1. Send credentials
WA -> GS : 2. Forward credentials

alt Success
    GS -> UAS : 3. Sends authentication request
    UAS -> UAS : 4. Verify credentials

    alt Verified
        UAS -> DB : Check user
        UAS <-- DB : 5. Returns user

        alt Passwords match
            GS <-- UAS : 6. Sends token
            WA <-- GS : Forwards token
            User <-- WA : 7. User logs in
        
        else Passwords do not match
            GS <-- UAS : Responds error
            WA <-- GS : Forwards error
            User <-- WA : Shows error
        end

    else Incorrect credentials
        GS <-- UAS : Responds error
        WA <-- GS : Forwards error
        User <-- WA : Shows error
    end
else Failure
    WA <-- GS : Forwards error
    User <-- WA : Shows error

end
----


This is the behaviour of the flawless execution of the login:

. The user types an username and a password.

. Then the Login.js (from the webapp package) collects this data and sends it via post to the "/login". 

. In the gateway service, a function answers to this request: forwards the petition to the User Authentication Service and saves the user data to the res, or when an error occurs, the error is saved to that variable.

. After that, the User Authentication Service checks and validates the given data, and asks the database to find the user for the given username.

. The database returns the user.

. The User Authentication Service verifies that the encrypted password given by the user and the encrypted password stored in the database match. If this happens, a JWT Token is generated and saved to the response.

. Shows visual confirmation of the login.
