.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the system’s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

=== <Runtime Scenario 1. Login and Authentication>
•	The user opens the application and is asked to log in.
•	They enter their credentials (username and password).
•	The client application sends an authentication request to the backend.
•	The backend verifies the credentials by checking in its database.
•	If login is successful, a session token is generated and sent back to the client.
•	The client stores the token for future requests.
•	If login fails, an error message is displayed, asking the user to try again.

=== <Runtime Scenario 2. Game Mode and Question Selection>
•	After logging in, the user navigates to the game selection screen.
•	The user selects a game mode (e.g., cities, historical figures, sports…).
•	The client requests a set of questions from the backend.
•	The game retrieves a set questions based on the  image from WikiData.
•	The questions and associated images are sent to the client.
•	The game session starts, displaying the first question.

=== <Runtime Scenario 3. Image-Based Questioning>
•	The app presents an image to the user based on the game topic.
•	The app gets the set of questions related to the image from the QuestionsDB, such as:
    o	"Which historical figure is shown in this photo?"
    o	"What city is this landmark located in?"
    o	"Which sport is depicted in this picture?"
    o	"Which historical event is depicted in this picture?"

•	The user selects an answer from multiple-choice options or types in a response.
•	The client sends the answer to the backend for validation.
•	The backend checks if the response matches the correct answer.
    •	If correct:
        o	The user earns points.
        o	The next question is displayed.
    •	If incorrect:
        o	The user can try again or request a hint


=== <Runtime Scenario 4. Hint System and AI Assistance>
•	If the user does not know the answer, they can request a hint.
•	The backend calls the AI to generate a hint based on the image and question.
•	Types of hints may include:
    o	A brief historical fact about the person, place, or event.
    o	A partial reveal of the answer.
    o	A clue referencing a relatedevent.
    o	Eliminating one wrong answer choices (if it is a multiple-choice question).
•	The hint is sent to the client and displayed to the user.
•	The user can then retry answering the question.

=== <Runtime Scenario 5. Game Progress and Score Management>
•	The game continues through a predefined number of images and questions.
•	The backend keeps track of the user’s progress, including:
    o	Score.
    o	Number of correct and incorrect answers.
    o	Time taken per question.
•	After the final question, the backend calculates the final score and stores it in the database.
•	The client displays a summary of the results.

=== <Runtime Scenario 6. . Leaderboard and Social Features>
•	The user’s score is compared against other players.
•	The backend updates the leaderboard using the scores database or a dedicated one.
•	The client displays rankings, showing top players.
