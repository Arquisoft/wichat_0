== Runtime View
This section focuses on describing the behaviour and interactions of the system's building blocks in form of scenarios.

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== User authentication


Users must have an account to use the application. The following sequence diagram shows how the application behaves when logging in.

[plantuml,"Sequence diagram",png]
----
actor User
entity WA as "Web Application"
entity GS as "Gateway Service"
entity UAS as "User Authentication Service"
database DB as "MongoDB"

User -> WA : 1. Send credentials
WA -> GS : 2. Forward credentials
GS -> UAS : 3. Sends authentication request
UAS -> DB : 4. Verify credentials

UAS <-- DB : 5. Returns user
User <-- UAS : 6. Sends token
----

. The user types an username and a password.

. Then the Login.js (from the webapp package) collects this data and sends it via post to the "/login". 

. In the gateway service, a function answers to this request: forwards the petition to the User Authentication Service and saves the user data to the res, or when an error occurs, the error is saved to that variable.

. After that, the User Authentication Service checks and validates the given data, and asks the database to find the user for the given username.

. The database returns the user.

. Finishing, the User Authentication Service verifies that the encrypted password given by the user and the encrypted password stored in the database match. If this happens, a JWT Token is generated and saved to the response.
