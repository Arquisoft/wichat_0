== Quality Requirements

This section documents all quality requirements for the system by using a quality tree and concrete scenarios. It builds upon the quality goals defined in section 1.2 and expands them.

The information provided here aligns with stakeholder expectations and allows for a measurable assessment of whether the system meets the defined quality criteria.


=== Quality Tree

The quality tree organizes the relevant quality attributes of the system starting from the root node "Quality/Usefulness" and is divided into the following primary categories:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Quality Attribute | Description

| Scalability (Priority: High) | The system must handle a large number of concurrent users without noticeable performance degradation.

| Reliability (Priority: High) | The system must be resilient to failures—particularly in communication with the hints generation API—to ensure an uninterrupted user experience.

| Usability (Priority: High) | The application should have an intuitive, user-friendly interface, enabling users to register, understand, and engage with the system quickly.

| Performance (Priority: Medium) | The system must deliver rapid responses—especially when generating questions and hints—to maintain a smooth and efficient user experience.

| Security (Priority: High) | The system must safeguard user data through robust encryption and strict access control measures.
|===

This structure can be visualized with a mind map or hierarchical diagram. For example, the following PlantUML diagram illustrates an example quality tree:

* Quality / Usefulness
** Scalability (Priority: High)
*** Supports large numbers of concurrent users
** Reliability (Priority: High)
*** Resilient to API and system failures
** Usability (Priority: High)
*** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface
** Performance (Priority: Medium)
*** Fast response times in critical operations
** Security (Priority: High)
*** Robust data protection and access control

=== Quality Scenarios

For each quality attribute in the tree, specific scenarios have been defined to articulate the expected system behavior under certain conditions. These scenarios include both usage scenarios (demonstrating normal operational performance) and change scenarios (illustrating the system’s response to modifications or unexpected events).

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"] 
|=== 
| Quality Attribute | Scenario | Priority

| Scalability | Load Scenario: When 10,000 users are concurrently active, the system must maintain a response time below 2 seconds for critical operations such as login and loading the game interface. | High

| Reliability | API Failure Scenario: If the external hints generation API fails, the system must activate a backup mechanism (e.g., preloaded hints or informative messages) and log the incident, ensuring the game continues uninterrupted. | High

| Usability | User Onboarding Scenario: A new user should be able to register, comprehend the application’s functionalities, and begin playing within 3 minutes, requiring fewer than 3 interactions (clicks) to access the main features. | High

| Performance | Response Time Scenario: Upon requesting a hint or answering a question, the system must process and deliver the information within 1 second, ensuring a seamless user experience. | Medium

| Security | Unauthorized Access Scenario: In the event of an unauthorized access attempt, the system must deny access, log the incident, and ensure that all user data remains protected through encryption and robust authentication. | High 
|===

Additionally, change scenarios—such as incorporating new functionalities or adapting to fluctuations in user demand—are considered. These scenarios will help evaluate the system’s capacity to evolve without compromising its key quality attributes.

The review and validation of these scenarios with stakeholders ensure that the quality requirements are aligned with the overall project objectives and provide clear guidance for architectural decisions throughout the system’s lifecycle.
