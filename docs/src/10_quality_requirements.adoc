== Quality Requirements

The **WIChat** system prioritizes five critical quality attributes to ensure success:  

1. **Usability**:  
   - Goal: An intuitive interface that allows users to play and access hints easily.  

2. **Maintainability**:  
   - Goal: Modular and well-documented code to facilitate updates.  

3. **Performance**:  
   - Goal: Low latency in critical operations:  
     - Question generation.  
     - LLM response.  

4. **Security**:  
   - Goal: Data protection and resistance to attacks.  

5. **Functionality**:  
   - Goal: Reliably meeting key business requirements:  
     - Automatic question/answer generation from Wikidata.  
     - Conversational hints with hallucination mitigation (RAG).  

These requirements guide technical decisions and ensure the system meets both RTVE's expectations and the end-user experience.
