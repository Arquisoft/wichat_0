=== Motivation

A well-defined deployment view provides a clear understanding of how different system components interact and operate within the infrastructure. This ensures smooth functionality, scalability, and maintainability.

=== Content

The deployment view represents the technical infrastructure that supports the systemâ€™s execution. The diagram offers a high-level visualization of key components and their interactions.

=== Deployment Architecture Components

* **User**: The end-user interacts with the system through the web application.
* **Web Application**: The central interface that connects users to the system.
* **Application Layer**: Manages multiple services, including:
  ** *LLM Service*: Interfaces with an external Large Language Model (**Gemini**) to process queries.
  ** *Question Service*: Handles question-related logic and interacts with the database using the **Wikidata API**.
  ** *User Service*: Manages user-related functionalities such as authentication and profile management.
* **Database Layer**: Uses MongoDB as the primary database for storing user and question-related data.
