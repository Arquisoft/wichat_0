== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure Level 1

The application will be deployed on an oracle server, using docker to run the different modules of the application. The application will use the wikidata API to get the different questions and answers of the game and an LLM API to do calls to the llm so that the user can interact with it and, for example ask for hints.

All of this will be deployed in an oracle server running ubuntu with the help of docker.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind the design of this application is to create a scalable, flexible, and secure system that can efficiently integrate with external APIs (such as Wikidata), while providing seamless user interactions through a web application. The core of the system revolves around managing various API calls, handling data storage, and ensuring a robust system that can keep up with the user demands.

To achieve this, we utilize a containerized microservices architecture, where each service (such as the Game Service, User Management, and API Gateway) is isolated in its own container. This separation allows for efficient scaling, improved fault tolerance, and the ability to update individual services independently. Additionally, the use of MongoDB ensures flexible, high-performance storage, while the API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all external and internal communication, providing load balancing, routing, and security functionalities.

The overall design enables the application to handle varying levels of demand, from individual user interactions to large-scale data processing, all while maintaining a high degree of security and performance. This approach not only supports future growth but also ensures that the system is easy to maintain and evolve over time.

**Quality and/or Performance Features**

Our system consists of several key containers that work together to ensure a smooth and scalable user experience. Below are the core features and quality attributes that define the system's architecture:

*Key Features*

* **Web Application**: The web app serves as the user interface where users interact with the system. It connects to the Gateway Service to make API calls and process user actions.

Endpoints

  `GET /signup` - Shows the signup screen to the user

  `POST /signup` - Sends the sign up information to the gateway service

  `GET /login` - Shows the signup screen to the user

  `POST /login` - Sends the sign up information to the gateway service

  `GET /quiz` - Shows the user a question from a quiz whose theme is specified as parameter

  `POST /quiz` - Submits the answer to the gateway service

  `GET /edit`- Shows the user a form in order to edit their data

  `POST /edit` - Sends the updated information to the gateway service

  `GET /stats` - Shows the user their game stats

* **Gateway Service**: The central point for routing all incoming requests. It ensures security, authentication, and routing to the appropriate service, whether it's the LLM Service, User-related services, or the Game Service.

Endpoints

  `GET /health` - Shows health status of the system

  `GET /quiz` - Retrieves quiz questions

  `POST /quiz` - Submits user answers

  `POST /login` - Authenticates user requests

  `POST /adduser` - Registers new users

  `POST /edituser` - Edits user information

  `GET /stats` - Requests a user historical playing data

  `POST /askllm` - Sends a question to the LLM Service

* **LLM Service**: A container dedicated to handling calls to the LLM API for processing user queries.

Endpoints

  `POST /hint` - Provides a hint to the player

* **User Gateway**: Manages user-related API calls, including user authentication and CRUD operations.
* **User CRUD Service**: Handles the CRUD operations for user data, interacting with the MongoDB database for persistent storage.
* **User Authentication Service**: Responsible for managing user authentication, ensuring that secure access to the application is maintained.

Endpoints

  `GET /users` - Retrieves a list of all users (admin use)

  `POST /users/search` - Searches for users based on filters (e.g., username, email)

* **Game Service**: Manages the game-related API calls, processing user inputs and interacting with external services like the Wikidata API to answer game-related questions.

Endpoints

  `GET /quiz` - Retrieves a batch of quiz questions from WikiData

  `POST /quiz` - Validates a user's answer

* **MongoDB Database**: Stores user data, including authentication and CRUD-related data, and ensures data integrity and persistence.

By organizing the system into these clear, well-defined containers, we ensure that each component can evolve independently, maintain security, and scale as required while providing a robust user experience.
