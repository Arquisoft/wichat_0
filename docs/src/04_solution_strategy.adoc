== Solution Strategy

=== Technological Decisions
For the development of the system, technologies have been selected to optimize performance, maintainability, and scalability of the project.

==== Programming Language: TypeScript
TypeScript was chosen as the main language for the project. Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript is a statically typed language, which helps with early error detection during programming. Its adoption avoided the need to completely migrate the existing JavaScript code to Java with Spring Boot.

==== Database: MongoDB
MongoDB was chosen as the NoSQL database. This database allows handling data in a flexible format and scaling efficiently, facilitating integration with Node.js.

==== Frameworks and Libraries
* *React.js:* Used for developing the user interface due to its modularity and ease of building interactive web applications.
* *Node.js:* Used as the runtime environment for the backend layer, enabling a full-stack architecture based on JavaScript/TypeScript.

==== Version Control: GitHub
GitHub was selected for version control. It allows for efficient source code management, continuous integration, and remote collaboration.

==== APIs: Wikidata
Wikidata will be used to retrieve structured information about any given topic. The system will query Wikidata to gather relevant data, which will then be processed to dynamically generate questions. By using Wikidata as a data source, the system ensures that the information is accurate and up-to-date.

.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.
