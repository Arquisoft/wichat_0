== Solution Strategy

=== Technology breakdown

[options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Reasons
| Use SpringBoot for developing the project | We are going to use [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to develop the project because:

- It gives us a lot of functionality already implemented so that we don't have to implement it ourselves.

- It allows us to use Java, which we are very used to and prefer over JavaScript.
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a database system | We will use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) because:

- It's already integrated in the user and authentication service

- It's the more popular non-relational database, and has a more or less simple syntax
| [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) as the LLM for generating hints | We will use (at least at first) Gemini because:

- It has a free tier with some limitations, but for our project it could be enough

- It's already integrated in the llm service

- It allows to send images 

- It has a way to handle hallucinations and errors

| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) for deploying the application | We will use Docker with Azure because:

| Decision | Reasons
| MVC architectural pattern | We will use MVC for the project because:

- It allows to divide the application into model, view and controller and are less coupled
| Microservices architecture | We will use the microservices architecture because:

- We can divide the project into independent services (other projects) that can be reusable

=== Organizational breakdown
Scrum,  Pull requests revision,

|===
| Decision | Reasons
| Weekly meeting | Up until this moment we are meeting only once a week because:

- We can work together at class in person

- We can be up to date with the things done, discuss the future decisions and see what problemas each teammate have

- Everyone have a moment to express themselves

| Whastsapp group | We are using a whatsapp group as a secondary way of communication because it's a common application for all of us and it can be accessed anywhere.
| GitLab Flow as branching strategy | The branching strategy ‘GitLab Flow’ will be used by the development team because:

- It is the branching strategy that fits better the team and project characteristics.

- It's simple as it only has 3-4 types of branches. It's less complex than Gitflow but more structured than Githubflow

- It's well divided, and allow simultaneous work on different features
