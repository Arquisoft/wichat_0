=== 1. Domain and Integration Concepts
The WIChat system relies on the seamless integration of multiple external sources to generate dynamic content:
  
==== Integration with External Sources
WIChat leverages external data from Wikidata and a Large Language Model (LLM) for automatically generating questions, hints, and related images. This integration follows RESTful API principles with JSON as the primary data exchange format. Key considerations include:
  
* **API Gateway and Mediator Pattern:** An API gateway is implemented to manage and route requests to external services. A mediator layer decouples the integration logic from core business functionalities.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** To improve performance and responsiveness, calls to external services are handled asynchronously. This includes the use of message queues to decouple request processing and ensure smooth operation during peak loads.
* **Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to manage API failures or slow responses. Automated retries, circuit breakers, and fallback strategies are applied to minimize disruption.
* **Data Validation:** Incoming data from external sources is rigorously validated to prevent issues like data inconsistency or LLM hallucinations, ensuring that only high-quality information is used in the application.

==== Integration Patterns
The architecture employs several integration patterns to maintain loose coupling and facilitate scalability:
  
* **Facade Pattern:** A facade provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems (Wikidata and LLM integration).
* **Adapter Pattern:** Custom adapters transform external data into the internal domain model, allowing for easy substitution of external providers.
* **Event-driven Architecture:** Events triggered by external data changes or updates allow the system to react in real time, further enhancing responsiveness.
* **Quality Assurance:** Implementing automated testing and validation processes ensures that generated content meets predefined standards before being published.


=== 2. Content Generation Management
Given that images, hints, and questions are generated dynamically, it is crucial to maintain content quality and consistency:

==== Business Rules and Validation
* **Quality Assurance:** Business rules are established to filter and validate automatically generated content. Confidence thresholds are defined to determine acceptable levels of uncertainty in LLM responses.
* **Fallback Strategies:** In cases where the content does not meet quality standards, predefined fallback strategies are triggered. These may include generating content from alternative data sources or providing default hints.
* **Caching Mechanisms:** Frequently requested or computed data is cached to reduce latency and minimize redundant calls to external APIs.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Detailed logs capture content generation events and errors, enabling continuous monitoring and rapid debugging of issues.

==== Continuous Improvement
* **Feedback Loop:** User feedback on content quality is collected and analyzed to iteratively improve the generation algorithms and validation rules.
* **Machine Learning Enhancements:** The system incorporates machine learning techniques to refine content generation over time, using historical data to predict and adjust quality parameters.


=== 3. Security and Access Control
Ensuring the security of user data and the integrity of system operations is paramount:

==== Authentication and Authorization
* **Robust Authentication:** Secure user authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, multi-factor authentication) are employed to verify user identity.
* **Fine-grained Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms ensure that users only have access to permitted functionalities and data.
* **Session Management:** Secure session handling is enforced, including session timeout and token revocation policies.
