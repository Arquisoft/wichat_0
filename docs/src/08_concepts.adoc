== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

==== User Experience (UX)

* *Usable Interface:*
|===
| Ease of Use | A simple, predictable, and familiar interface design will be presented, ensuring that all essential elements and options of the application are easily accessible.
| Intuitive | The system will provide an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to understand.
| Stability | The application's loading times will be minimized to ensure a smooth experience.
|===

* *Immediate Feedback:* The user will instantly see whether their answer was correct or not. Additionally, the game history, rankings, and generated questions will always be up to date.


==== Security & Protection

* *Secure Access Control:* User authentication security will be enforced by verifying the correctness of the entered credentials and denying access otherwise.


==== Under-the-Hood

* *Persistence:* Both user data and game records will be stored to ensure their integrity and availability.
* *Maintainability:* The code is written clearly and legibly, following a modular approach to facilitate maintenance when fixing bugs or adding improvements.
* *Extensibility:* The application is built in a way that allows new functionalities to be added easily in the future without significantly affecting existing components.


==== Development

* *Implementation:* The application will be developed using JavaScript. The front-end will be built with React, while Node.js and microservices architecture will be used for the back-end. MongoDB will be used for managing the NoSQL database.
* *Testing:* Various tests will be conducted to ensure a high-quality product.


==== Architectural Style

* *Layers:* A three-layer architecture will be implemented to ensure better organization and modularity:
|===
| Presentation | Responsible for operating and generating the graphical interface displayed to the user.
| Business Logic | Where all the necessary logic for the correct operation of the application will be executed.
| Persistence | Used to store and retrieve various data needed for both the player and the question-and-answer game system.
