== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain Concepts
The system revolves around an interactive quiz where users answer image-based questions. Key domain concepts include:
* **Users:** Can register, log in, and track their game history.
* **Questions:** Generated from Wikidata, consisting of an image and multiple-choice answers.
* ***Game Modes:** You can choose different game modes.
* **Hints:** AI-generated clues provided by an external LLM API.
* **Game Sessions:** Users participate in timed quizzes, competing for scores.
* **Leaderboard:** Tracks user performance based on accuracy and speed.

=== User Experience (UX) Concepts
To ensure a seamless and engaging user experience:
* **Responsive Design:** The web interface adapts to different devices using Bootstrap.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** A simple and clear UI layout with a focus on gameplay.
* **Feedback System:** Immediate response validation and progress tracking.
* **Ergonomics  ** Ergonomics is the discipline focused on designing and arranging workspaces, products,
        and systems to adapt to the needs of the people using them. Its goal is to enhance comfort, efficiency,
        and safety by considering human physical and psychological limitations.

* **Internationalization ** The application should support multiple languages and regions to ensure accessibility
    for users from different countries and cultures. Currently, it is available in Spanish, English, German and France.

=== Security Concepts
Security is critical due to user authentication and data handling:
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented using Spring Security with JWT.
* **Data Encryption:** Passwords hashed with bcrypt and sensitive data encrypted.
* **API Security:** Access control enforced through role-based permissions.
* **Rate Limiting:** Protection against abuse using API throttling.

=== Architecture and Design Patterns
The system follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern:
* **Model:** Entities representing users, questions, and game sessions.
* **View:** Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendering.
* **Controller:** Spring Boot REST controllers handling requests and responses.
* **Service Layer:** Encapsulates business logic, ensuring separation of concerns.
* **Repository Layer:** Uses Spring Data JPA for efficient database interactions.

=== Development Concepts
Best practices for development include:
* **Testing Strategy:** TO DO
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
* **Code Quality:** Static code analysis with SonarQube.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Implemented with Logback and Prometheus.

=== Operational Concepts
To ensure reliability and scalability:
* **Containerization:** Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.
* **Database Management:** MySQL with scheduled backups.
* **Load Balancing:** Managed through Nginx for high availability.
* **Observability:** Monitoring with Grafana and centralized logging.

This structured approach ensures a **secure, scalable, and maintainable** system while delivering a seamless user experience.
