== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== 1. Domain and Integration Concepts
The WIChat system relies on the seamless integration of multiple external sources to generate dynamic content:
  
==== Integration with External Sources
WIChat leverages external data from Wikidata and a Large Language Model (LLM) for automatically generating questions, hints, and related images. This integration follows RESTful API principles with JSON as the primary data exchange format. Key considerations include:
  
* **API Gateway and Mediator Pattern:** An API gateway is implemented to manage and route requests to external services. A mediator layer decouples the integration logic from core business functionalities.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** To improve performance and responsiveness, calls to external services are handled asynchronously. This includes the use of message queues to decouple request processing and ensure smooth operation during peak loads.
* **Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to manage API failures or slow responses. Automated retries, circuit breakers, and fallback strategies are applied to minimize disruption.
* **Data Validation:** Incoming data from external sources is rigorously validated to prevent issues like data inconsistency or LLM hallucinations, ensuring that only high-quality information is used in the application.

==== Integration Patterns
The architecture employs several integration patterns to maintain loose coupling and facilitate scalability:
  
* **Adapter Pattern:** Custom adapters transform external data into the internal domain model, allowing for easy substitution of external providers.
* **Event-driven Architecture:** Events triggered by external data changes or updates allow the system to react in real time, further enhancing responsiveness.
* **Quality Assurance:** Implementing automated testing and validation processes ensures that generated content meets predefined standards before being published.


=== 2. Content Generation Management
Given that images, hints, and questions are generated dynamically, it is crucial to maintain content quality and consistency:

==== Business Rules and Validation
* **Quality Assurance:** Business rules are established to filter and validate automatically generated content. Confidence thresholds are defined to determine acceptable levels of uncertainty in LLM responses.
* **Fallback Strategies:** In cases where the content does not meet quality standards, predefined fallback strategies are triggered. These may include generating content from alternative data sources or providing default hints.
* **Caching Mechanisms:** Frequently requested or computed data is cached to reduce latency and minimize redundant calls to external APIs.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Detailed logs capture content generation events and errors, enabling continuous monitoring and rapid debugging of issues.


=== 3. Security and Access Control
Ensuring the security of user data and the integrity of system operations is paramount:

==== Authentication and Authorization
* **Robust Authentication:** Secure user authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, multi-factor authentication) are employed to verify user identity.
* **Fine-grained Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms ensure that users only have access to permitted functionalities and data.
* **Session Management:** Secure session handling is enforced, including session timeout and token revocation policies.

==== Data Protection and Privacy
* **Encryption:** All sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, is protected using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS, AES).
* **Compliance:** The system adheres to relevant data protection regulations and standards, ensuring user privacy and legal compliance.


=== 4. Scalability and Performance
The architectural design of WIChat ensures that the system can handle fluctuating loads and maintain high performance:

==== Scalability Strategies
* **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling:** The system is designed to support both horizontal scaling (adding more servers) and vertical scaling (enhancing server capacity) as needed.
* **Caching and Asynchronous Processing:** Use of caching (e.g., in-memory caches, CDN) and asynchronous processing helps minimize latency and improve throughput during high demand periods.

==== Performance Optimization
* **Resource Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of system metrics (CPU, memory, network usage) ensures that performance remains within acceptable thresholds.
* **Optimized Data Access:** Database queries and data storage mechanisms are optimized to support rapid data retrieval and updates.
* **Load Testing:** Regular load and stress tests simulate peak usage scenarios to validate performance and identify potential weaknesses.


=== 5. Consistency in User Experience (UX)
A unified user experience is essential for user satisfaction and system usability:

==== UI/UX Guidelines
* **Design Consistency:** Adherence to a comprehensive style guide ensures that all user interfaces are consistent in terms of colors, typography, and layout.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to function seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
* **User-Centered Design:** Interfaces are crafted based on user feedback and usability testing, ensuring intuitive navigation and interaction.
* **Real-Time Feedback:** Mechanisms for providing immediate feedback (e.g., progress indicators, confirmation messages) enhance the overall user experience.

==== Accessibility and Internationalization
* **Accessibility Standards:** The design follows accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) to ensure that the system is usable by individuals with disabilities.
* **Internationalization:** Support for multiple languages and regional settings is integrated into the application, allowing users from diverse backgrounds to interact with the system effortlessly [**to be done**].

==== Continuous UX Improvement
* **Analytics and User Testing:** Ongoing collection of user interaction data and periodic usability tests help refine the user experience.
* **Iterative Design:** The design process is iterative, incorporating regular updates based on evolving user needs and technological advancements.
