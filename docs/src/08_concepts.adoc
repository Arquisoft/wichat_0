== Cross-cutting Concepts

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks and secures consistency and integrity.

They can include many different topics, such as:

- models, especially domain models, which are important for the deployment of the project.
- architecture or design patterns.
- rules for using specific technology, to find out what we have implemented and why.
- principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature.
- implementation rules.


.Motivation
The most important concepts that our project will follow are the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 

Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied in many different ways:

* concept papers with any kind of structure.
* cross-cutting model excepts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views.
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts.
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping).

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain Concepts.
* User Experience Concepts (UX).
* Safety and security Concepts.
* Architecture and design patterns.
* "Under-the-hood".
* Development Concepts.
* Operational Concepts.

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

Some important concepts need to be taken into account so as to a better understanding of the application. These concepts have to do with the following categories.

. Domain concepts.
. User Experience (UX).
. Operation Concepts.
. Architecture and Design Patterns.
. Development Concepts.

Next, each category will be detailed.

=== Domain concepts
At the moment, the application follows this schema:

image::08_domain_model_1.png["Current version of the domain model"]

* **User**: it is the person that uses the application. Multiple user sessions are an option in this application. 
* **Contest**: The contest is the part that the User can see. It contains everything the user can do, such as play games, be part of groups or look for rankings and statistics.
* **Game**: The User can play different games, including _The Challenge_, _Wise Men Stack_ or even a multiplayer mode, which enables various Users to play together. Games consist of several questions to which users have to answer. Down below there is an schema that show the different game modes that are available.
* **Question**: Each question has different answers but only one of them is correct. Answering correctly to the questions rewards users with _points_.
* **Statistics**: Each user has statistics that show different aspects of their profile, such as the time they invested on each game mode, correct and incorrect questions, etc.
* **Profile**: User's profile has data such as their username and the amount on _points_ they have earned. They can also choose a profile picture from between some given avatars.
* **Group**: Users are able to join or create groups, that way the can get to a groups ranking.

* **Wise Men Stack**: The player chooses a topic from the available options and must answer a battery of questions related to it within 60 seconds. For each question, the host provides two options. If the contestant guesses correctly, they move on to the next question.
* **Warm Question**: It consists of some topics of varied themes. For each correct answer, €100 is earned, and €10 are lost if the contestant passes, does not respond, or answers incorrectly.
* **Discovering Cities**: The contestant will face a challenge where they will be repeatedly asked questions referring to different cities around the world. To successfully overcome the challenge, the contestant must answer as many questions as possible correctly throughout the test. Time and number of questions are fixed.
* **The Challenge**: It is the quintessential game mode, as it allows you to customize the match to your liking. This game mode is tailored for those who wish to practice certain game formats before engaging in our various other game modes. Number of questions, time per question and category can be set.
* **Multiplayer**: Create a room and share the room code with other players to play. It also has a room chat.



=== User Experience (UX)
- Easy registration: The user can register or log in with accounts already created on an intuitive page. 
- Several modes: They can also play different game modes and to consult their historial record, statistics, and even some rankings.
- https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Frontend**]: the frontend of this application consists of a deployed web app which is deployed. 
- https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Internationalization**] The application is available in various languages, including English as the main language. This would provide a better user experience as users could better tailor the application to their personal preferences.
- Better user experience: Users can easily choose the game mode they prefer and play.

=== Operation Concepts
- Usability: We tried for the application to be easy to use. For this reason, we will try to spread this application to several types of persons, to complete and expand its strengths and weaknesses and improve them. 
- Usability affects User Experience as well, so it is an important aspect of the application.
- Tics and crosses as well as colours to know if questions are correct or not.
- Adaptive application for color blind people, for knowing if they got the answer correct or not easily.


=== Security
* We have implemented some security in the application, which will be listed now. 
- Some blocked sites if the user is not logged in an account: This way, we avoid external people to be able to access our application as it could lead to other security issues.
- Passwords with a minimal security level: They need to be at least 8 characters longs and they must contain upper and lower letters, numbers and special characters. 
- Encrypted passwords: In case that the batabase is stolen, data would still be secure. 

=== Architecture and Design Patterns
- https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Microservice**]: In this application there are some microservices such as the User Management, which involves signing up, logging in and everything related to the points and timing of the user. Microservices provide an easy way of creating a complex application composed by independent systems.
- Questions generation system: It is a microservice that creates infinite questions related to several topics, with only one type of questions: related to images. In that type of question, an image will be given for the user to guess what it is, with only one correct answer and three distractors.
- Graphic interface: Users are able to communicate with the application to this service.

All of the architectural decisions that have taken place through the application creation are specified in the https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_es04a/wiki[repository Wiki section]

=== Development Concepts
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests for each functionality and end-to-end (e2e) tests for core gameplay features.
- https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_acronyms[**CI/CD**]: The application is in continuous integration and deployment. Team members commit frequently into the repository where the project is stored. This makes it easier when assembling project parts involving collaboration from different team members.
