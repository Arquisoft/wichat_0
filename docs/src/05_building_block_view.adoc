==== Motivation

The **Whitebox Overall System** diagram provides a high-level representation of the primary components and their interactions within the application, alongside the external systems it integrates with. This diagram is crucial for understanding the foundational architecture of the platform, showcasing the flow of data, system responsibilities, and external dependencies. It emphasizes the relationships between the various building blocks, such as the interaction between the user and the system, and how dynamic content is sourced via external APIs.

==== Contained Building Blocks

The key building blocks forming the overall system architecture include:

* **User**: Represents the end-user of the platform, who is required to authenticate in order to access the game functionality. Once authenticated, users can interact with the system and participate in gameplay.

* **Wichat EN2B Application**: The core application responsible for managing game mechanics, including the generation of questions and content. It encapsulates the application’s game logic and drives the user experience. Detailed breakdowns of its internal components are explored further in later sections.

* **WikiData API**: A third-party API providing structured knowledge, essential for the dynamic generation of trivia questions and content. The system queries the WikiData API for real-time data, which is used to populate game questions.

* **LLM API**: Another third-party API used for providing hints in response to user queries. It leverages large language models (such as GPT-based systems) to dynamically generate contextual content for enhancing user interactions. **Communication with the LLM occurs in a conversational manner**, where each request includes the entire conversation history (i.e., a list of all previous messages) to ensure context and continuity across interactions.

==== Important Interfaces

The **Important Interfaces** section defines the key interactions between system components and explains the methods through which the business requirements are met.

* **User to System Interaction**: Users engage with the system via a **web client** interface, which provides a rich UI experience with interactive elements such as forms, buttons, and dynamic feedback mechanisms. This client ensures a seamless user experience throughout the gameplay.

* **System to WikiData API Interaction**: The Wichat EN2B application interfaces with the **WikiData API** using a **question generator module**. This module sends HTTP requests containing **SPARQL queries** to retrieve structured knowledge from WikiData, which is subsequently processed and used to generate game questions.

* **System to LLM API Interaction**: The Wichat EN2B application communicates with the **LLM API** by passing the entire chat history of the logged-in user in each request. This ensures that the language model has full context of the ongoing conversation, enabling the generation of hints and responses that are contextually relevant and consistent with previous exchanges.

* **Internal Services Communication**: Internal services within the Wichat EN2B application communicate over **RESTful APIs**. For example, the **Gateway Service** routes incoming requests to the appropriate internal services, while the **Game Service** ensures game state management and flow control.

=== Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)

==== Container Diagram

==== Motivation

The **Container Diagram** offers a more granular view of the Wichat EN2B application’s architecture, illustrating how the application is organized into discrete containers (services) and the relationships between them. This diagram is instrumental in detailing the internal structure of the system and clarifying how the platform's various components work together to deliver its functionality.

It serves as an essential tool for understanding how user interactions are processed, how game logic is managed, and how both external and internal data sources are leveraged for seamless gameplay.
