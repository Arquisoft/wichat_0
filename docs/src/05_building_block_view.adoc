== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

image::05_overall_system.png[Overview Diagram]

Motivation::

The Wichat EN2B system is designed to provide users with an interactive quiz platform where they can register, log in, answer questions generated dynamically from WikiData, 
request hints from an LLM in a conversational manner, and track their statistics over time. The architecture is modular to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

Contained Building Blocks::

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| Name | Responsibility
| Web Application | Provides the front-end interface for users to interact with the system.
| Gateway Service | Acts as an API gateway that routes requests to appropriate backend services.
| Game Service | Manages quiz generation, pulling questions from WikiData.
| LLM Service | Handles interactions with the LLM to provide hints for users.
| User Gateway | Facilitates communication between the Gateway Service and user-related services.
| User CRUD Service | Manages user information in the database (registration, profile management, etc.).
| User Authentication Service | Handles authentication and session management.
| MongoDB Database | Stores user information and quiz-related data.
| Documentation System | Manages internal documentation.
|===

Important Interfaces::


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

==== <Name black box 1>

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

=== Level 2

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.
