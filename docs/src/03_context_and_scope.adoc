The application has a main part where all the logic is performed for the application(generate questions with WIKIDATA, get the hint from the IA, store users and check if they exists, ...).
For the storage of the users or the questions it's used a database, in this case we use MongoDB.

Also this part uses different API's to provide info for the question and for getting an image, and let the users have a hint for the question using AI.
Finally we have were the app is going to be deployed to let de user play the game.
