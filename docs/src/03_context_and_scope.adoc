== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

The wichat_es4b system is an interactive web-based application designed as a quiz game similar to "Saber y Ganar". Users can register, log in, and interact with a language model (LLM) to receive dynamically generated questions and answers. The system ensures secure authentication and structured data retrieval to enhance the gaming experience.

==== Involved Actors

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Actor | Description
| User | A person who accesses the application to play the quiz game.
| Administrator | Responsible for managing system infrastructure and security.
| LLM Provider | External service that provides AI-generated quiz questions.
| Database | MongoDB used to store user information and game history.
|===

==== Business Context Table

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs | Outputs
| User | Login credentials, game interactions | Quiz questions, score updates
| LLM Provider | Quiz prompts | AI-generated questions and answers
| Database | User data, game records | Stored authentication and game history

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

**<Mapping Input/Output to Channels>**

The system consists of several services developed in Node.js with Express, a React web application, and a MongoDB database. Communication between services is handled via REST API and WebSockets.

==== Technical Interfaces

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Component | Technology | Interface
| Webapp | React | Connects to the Gateway Service via REST API
| Gateway Service | Express (Node.js) | Exposes the public API
| User Service | Express (Node.js) | REST API with access to MongoDB
| Auth Service | Express (Node.js) | REST API for user authentication
| LLM Service | Express (Node.js) | REST API with external LLM connection
|===

==== Mapping Input/Output to Channels

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Input/Output | Channel
| User actions | Web application via HTTPS
| Authentication requests | REST API via JWT tokens
| Quiz questions and responses | REST API with LLM service
| User data storage | MongoDB database
