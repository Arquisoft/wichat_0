== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

**The WIChat system**

****
endif::arc42help[]

WIChat is an interactive web-based quiz game application, inspired by "Saber y Ganar". Users can register, log in, and play the game, where they are presented with images and have to guess the associated place or object. The novelty lies in the integration of a conversational language model (LLM), which allows users to interact with the game and get hints for the answers dynamically. The questions and images are generated from Wikidata, providing an automated, real-time experience.

==== Involved Actors

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Actor | Description
| User | A person who accesses the application to play the quiz game.
| Administrator | Responsible for managing system infrastructure and security.
| LLM Provider | External service that provides AI-generated quiz questions and hints.
| Database | MongoDB used to store user information, game history, and question data.
| WikiData | External service used to retrieve image and metadata for question generation.

==== Business Context Table

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs | Outputs
| User | Login credentials, game interactions | Quiz questions, score updates
| LLM Provider | Quiz prompts | AI-generated questions and answers
| Database | User data, game records | Stored authentication and game history
| WikiData | Data requests for images and metadata | Retrieved image and metadata for questions

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

The system consists of several services developed in Java using Spring Boot, a web frontend using HTML, and a MongoDB database. Communication between services is handled via REST API and HTTPS.

==== Technical Interfaces

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Component | Technology | Interface
| Web Application | HTML, Spring (Java) | Connects to backend services via HTTPS
| User Service | Spring (Java) | REST API for managing user data (login, history)
| Question Service | Spring (Java) | REST API to retrieve and display questions and images
| LLM Service | External (REST API) | Connects to external LLM provider for dynamic hints
| WikiData Service | External (REST API) | Retrieves image and question metadata from Wikidata
| Database | MongoDB | Stores user data, game history, and question data

==== Mapping Input/Output to Channels

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Component | Input/Output | Channel/Protocol
| RestApiService | External developer interactions | HTTPS
| Frontend | User interactions, game display | HTTPS
| Database | User data, game history, questions | Specific database driver (MongoDB)
| WikiData | Data for question generation | HTTP
| Question Generator | Generated questions | In-memory
| Question Service | Questions for game | In-memory
