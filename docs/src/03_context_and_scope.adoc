* Player (user, person): the player interacts with our system by using the front-end or user interface of the
application to play the question games.

* Our system (internal system) : our system allows the player to play the question games, and it will interact with the
WikiData API and LLM API by using queries to get the questions and options, and to ask for hints related to the
questions respectively.

* WikiData API: API to extract the information for generating the different questions, options and answers.

* LLM API: API to ask to an AI for hints related to the question shown to the user.

The application is deployed using Docker with Azure. The whole application:
The user interacts with the web app (front-end of the app). It will be a SpringBoot project that will contain the user
interfaces and ask the other parts of the application the different data that it needs. So, it acts as a Controller.

The services will be:

* Authentication service
* Users service (statistics)
* Question generation service (WikiData)
* Hint service (LLM)
* Game service

Many services will interact with the database (MongoDB) to add information for different entities (Questions, Usersâ€¦)
