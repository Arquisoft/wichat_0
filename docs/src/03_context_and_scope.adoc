== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).


.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context
The system interacts with several external entities:

* **User**: interacts with the system through a web interface.
* **Wikidata**: supplies data for dynamically generated quiz questions.
* **Groq**: an LLM API from LLaMA used for providing hints related to quiz questions.
* **Database**: the system interacts with a database storing user-related data.

|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs to System | Outputs from System
| **Player (User)** | Login credentials, answer selection and hint requests |Questions, feedback, hints, scores 
| **WikiData API** | Query for quiz questions | Response with data and images 
| **Groq API (LLM)** | User questions | AI-generated hints 
| **Database** | Game data | Persistent data (authentication, leaderboards...) 
| **Node.js** | User authentication information | Sucessful/unsuccessful login
|===

=== Technical Context
The system is linked to several technical interfaces:

* **Frontend-Backend Communication**: The client uses React.js to communicate with the Node.js backend through RESTful API calls.
* **Backend-Database Communication**: The backend of the system interacts with a database through SQL (?).
* **External APIs**: Some external APIs are used for taking advantage of services such as question generation (WikiData) and hint generation (Groq AI).

.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
