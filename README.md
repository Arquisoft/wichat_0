## Quick start guide

First, clone the project:

```git clone git@github.com:arquisoft/wichat_en3a.git```

### LLM API key configuration

In order to communicate with the LLM integrated in this project, we need to setup an API key.
We have to create a .env file in the hintservice directory with this format:
llm.apikey=YOUR_API_KEY

Note that this file must NOT be uploaded to the github repository (they are excluded in the .gitignore).

An extra configuration for the LLM to work in the deployed version of the app is to include it as a repository secret (HINTSERVICE_API_KEY). This secret will be used by GitHub Action when building and deploying the application.


### Launching Using docker
For launching the propotipe using docker compose, just type:
```docker compose --profile dev up --build```

### Component by component start
First, start the database. Either install and run Mongo or run it using docker:

```docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name=my-mongo mongo:latest```

You can use also services like Mongo Altas for running a Mongo database in the cloud.

Then you have to launch all the services manually (using some IDE or Maven and Java from the command line)

After all the components are launched, the app should be available in localhost in port 8000.

## Deployment
For the deployment, we have several options. The first and more flexible is to deploy to a virtual machine using SSH. This will work with any cloud service (or with our own server). Other options include using the container services that all the cloud services provide. This means, deploying our Docker containers directly. Here I am going to use the first approach. I am going to create a virtual machine in a cloud service and after installing docker and docker-compose, deploy our containers there using GitHub Actions and SSH.

### Machine requirements for deployment
The machine for deployment can be created in services like Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS. These are in general the settings that it must have:

- Linux machine with Ubuntu > 20.04 (the recommended is 24.04).
- Docker installed.
- Open ports for the applications installed (in this case, ports 3000 for the webapp and 8000 for the gateway service).

Once you have the virtual machine created, you can install **docker** using the following instructions:

```ssh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

### Continuous delivery (GitHub Actions)
Once we have our machine ready, we could deploy by hand the application, taking our docker-compose file and executing it in the remote machine. In this repository, this process is done automatically using **GitHub Actions**. The idea is to trigger a series of actions when some condition is met in the repository. The precondition to trigger a deployment is going to be: "create a new release". The actions to execute are the following:

As you can see, unitary tests of each module and e2e tests are executed before pushing the docker images and deploying them. Using this approach we avoid deploying versions that do not pass the tests.

The deploy action is the following:

```yml
deploy:
    name: Deploy over SSH
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [docker-push-userservice,docker-push-authservice,docker-push-llmservice,docker-push-gatewayservice,docker-push-webapp]
    steps:
    - name: Deploy over SSH
      uses: fifsky/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
        user: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
        key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
        command: |
          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arquisoft/wichat_en3a/master/docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml
          docker compose --profile prod down
          docker compose --profile prod up -d --pull always
```

This action uses three secrets that must be configured in the repository:
- DEPLOY_HOST: IP of the remote machine.
- DEPLOY_USER: user with permission to execute the commands in the remote machine.
- DEPLOY_KEY: key to authenticate the user in the remote machine.

Note that this action logs in the remote machine and downloads the docker-compose file from the repository and launches it. Obviously, previous actions have been executed which have uploaded the docker images to the GitHub Packages repository.
